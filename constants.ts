    question: "What is a root canal treatment and why is it needed?",
    answer:
      "A root canal treatment is a dental procedure used to treat infection at the centre of a tooth (the pulp). It is necessary when the pulp becomes infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures on the tooth, or a crack or chip in the tooth. This treatment helps save the tooth and prevent the infection from spreading.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect during a root canal procedure?",
    answer:
      "During a root canal procedure, your dentist will remove the infected pulp, clean and disinfect the inside of the tooth, and then fill and seal it. The procedure is usually done under local anaesthesia to minimise discomfort. After the root canal, a crown is often placed on the tooth to restore its strength and function.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I care for my tooth after a root canal treatment?",
    answer:
      "After a root canal treatment, it is important to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly. Avoid chewing on hard foods with the treated tooth until a permanent crown is placed. Attend all follow-up appointments with your dentist to ensure the tooth heals properly and to receive the final restoration. Regular dental check-ups are also essential to monitor the health of your teeth and gums.",

You wear each set of aligners for about two weeks before moving on to the next set, with regular check-ups to monitor progress.",
  },
  
  {
    question: "How long does Invisalign treatment take?",
    answer:
      "The duration of Invisalign treatment varies depending on the complexity of your case. On average, treatment can take between 12 to 18 months. Your dentist will provide a more accurate timeline based on your specific needs during your initial consultation.",
  },
  
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of Invisalign compared to traditional braces?",

    answer:
      "Internal tooth whitening is a procedure used to lighten a tooth that has darkened due to internal staining, often as a result of trauma, decay, or a previous root canal treatment. Unlike external whitening, which treats the outer surface, internal whitening targets the discolouration from within the tooth.",
  },
  
  {
    question: "How is the internal tooth whitening procedure performed?",
    answer:
      "During the internal whitening procedure, a bleaching agent is placed inside the tooth. The tooth is then sealed temporarily, allowing the bleaching agent to work from within. This process may need to be repeated several times over a few weeks until the desired level of whiteness is achieved.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of internal tooth whitening last?",
    answer:
      "The results of internal tooth whitening can last several years, but it depends on your oral hygiene habits and dietary choices. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene practices can help maintain the whiteness of the treated tooth.",
